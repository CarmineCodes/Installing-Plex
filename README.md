# How to install Plex Media Server on Linux

This writeup will cover how to install Plex Media Server on a linux machines to self-host your own media server.

## Getting Started

To start, you can run Plex in many ways whether in a docker container, to off a nas, or how this will cover in a virtual machine off a server. This can also be a standalone box running a flavor of linux. For this, I am going to use Ubuntu server 20.04 LTS.

For system requirements, Plex recommends at least an intel core i3, this varies by how many people you intend to use your server. I typically give my Vmâ€™s 2 cores for plex.

For ram, at least 2 gb but this also will need to vary depending on how many users there will be.
I would advise to give the VM a drive of 50 gb and host the media off the machine in a nas or network drive.


### Prerequisites

Power your new (or old) linux machine up and make sure is it all updated.

Run:

    sudo apt update

and

    sudo apt upgrade -y

After the machine is up to date, we are ready to install Plex.

### Installing

In your linux machine, make a new directory for the plex installer.

    sudo mkdir PlexInstaller

then navigate to The official plex site and under download, find the latest version of Plex Server for linux.

    https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/#plex-media-server

From there, Select Linux, there will be a button for Choose Distro, click on that then a menu of flavors will open.
