# How to install Plex Media Server on Linux

This writeup will cover how to install Plex Media Server on a linux machines to self-host your own media server.

## Getting Started

To start, you can run Plex in many ways whether in a docker container, to off a nas, or how this will cover in a virtual machine off a server. This can also be a standalone box running a flavor of linux. For this, I am going to use Ubuntu server 20.04 LTS.

For system requirements, Plex recommends at least an intel core i3, this varies by how many people you intend to use your server. I typically give my Vmâ€™s 2 cores for plex.

For ram, at least 2 gb but this also will need to vary depending on how many users there will be.
I would advise to give the VM a drive of 50 gb and host the media off the machine in a nas or network drive.


### Prerequisites

Power your new (or old) linux machine up and make sure is it all updated.

Run:

    sudo apt update

and

    sudo apt upgrade -y

After the machine is up to date, we are ready to install Plex.

### Installing

In your linux machine, make a new directory for the plex installer.

    sudo mkdir PlexInstaller

then navigate to The official plex site and under download, find the latest version of Plex Server for linux.

    https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/#plex-media-server

From there, Select Linux, there will be a button for Choose Distro, click on that then a menu of flavors will open.

Right click on the flavor of linux you are running and click copy link in the menu that opens.


After grabbing the link to the latest version

change directories into the new directory and wget the link you copied.

    wget paste the link
 
 The output should like like this

after getting the installer, add execution right to the file so we can run the installer. To do this, run the following command

    sudo chmod +x the file name

you will be prompted to enter your password and then the new file rights will be added, you can check with

    ls -lah
  
then you will see

    -rwxrwxr-x
 
this shows that the file has execution permissions added to it.

Now the installer is ready to be ran.

To run the installer use

    ./thefilename
    
This will run the installer we downloaded and begin to download it onto the machine.

After the installer is finished, plex is done installing and is ready to use.

We do need to add it to the firewall on the machine, to do this run

    sudo ufw allow 32400
   
This will open the port on the machine to allow Plex traffic to head outbound.

If you get an error that ufw isnt installed, run

    sudo apt install ufw

This will install ufw, after that run the command to open the port again and it will open it up.

## Updating Plex

When Plex releases new updates, you should read over the release notes and make sure its nothing to drastic and you feel comfortale installing the newest version. The easiest way to do this is to add the Plex repo to all the repos your machine uses when you update it. To do this run the command below

    echo deb https://downloads.plex.tv/repo/deb public main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/plexmediaserver.list

then

    curl https://downloads.plex.tv/plex-keys/PlexSign.key | sudo apt-key add -

Now the plex repos are added so when you update your machine it will also update Plex.

### Accessing Plex

Now that Plex is installed you are ready to access it, to do so you will go to the IP address of the machine with port 32400

    hostip:32400
    
 There you should see the welcome screen asking you to sign in or make an account.

After you make your account, plex is ready to be used, you can connect a drive of media however you'd like and start streaming.
